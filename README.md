# AppleTrek
## A Trek Clone for the Apple ][ Home Computer

AppleTrek is a clone of the original [Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)) game written for the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series) family of computers. I have uploaded this source code mainly for preservation and historical reference, but I encourage anyone to hack away at the code and make something new.

AppleTrek was written in [Applesoft BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC), an early microcomputer BASIC intrepreter. The `appletrek.bas` file was ripped from the BASIC source code found on the included disk image file `appletrek.so` which was taken from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/a2_Apple_Trek_1979_Apple).

See my other repository, [Super Star Trek](https://github.com/agiacalone/super-startrek), for the mainframe version.
